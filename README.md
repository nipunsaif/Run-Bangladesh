# Run Bangladesh - Run For Better Bangladesh

## Project Idea: 
Run Bangladesh: Run For Better Bangladesh is a comprehensive mobile app designed to streamline the management of running events, both for internal races hosted by Run Bangladesh and services provided to other event organizers. The app will enable users to register for marathons, half-marathons, and other running events while also providing tools for event organizers to manage participant data, schedules, registrations, and multimedia content like photos and videos. Features such as real-time race tracking, event result posting, and service bookings (like photography and videography) will ensure a seamless experience for both participants and event organizers.
